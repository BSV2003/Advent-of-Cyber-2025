# Advent-of-Cyber-2025

In Advent of Cyber 2025, the peaceful town of Wareville is preparing for the annual SOC-mas celebrations.  
But something is wrong this year.

McSkidy, the defender who usually protects TBFC (The Best Festival Company), has suddenly vanished.  
At the same time, a new threat has appeared: **King Malhare**, spreading chaos from HopSec Island and attempting to replace SOC-mas with his own twisted holiday, EAST-mas.

Strange events begin unfolding across Wareville—tampered files, suspicious logins, corrupted systems, and unusual digital footprints. Each day's challenge uncovers a new clue about what happened, who is responsible, and how deep the attack goes.

Our mission throughout Advent of Cyber is to:
- Investigate the incidents happening across the network  
- Uncover how King Malhare infiltrated TBFC  
- Trace the attacks back to their source  
- Recover missing data  
- And ultimately discover what happened to McSkidy and save SOC-mas  

Each challenge reveals another piece of the mystery, gradually guiding you toward the truth behind the attack and how to stop EAST-mas before it takes over.
