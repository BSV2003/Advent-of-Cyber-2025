# Phishing Overview

Phishing may be one of the oldest cyber tricks, but it’s still one of the most effective.

Modern phishing focuses on precision and persuasion. Messages are carefully crafted, often mimicking real people, portals, or internal processes to trick even the most cautious users.

Common intentions behind phishing messages:
- **Credential theft:** Tricking users into revealing passwords or login details.
- **Malware delivery:** Disguising malicious attachments or links as safe content.
- **Data exfiltration:** Gathering sensitive company or personal information.
- **Financial fraud:** Persuading victims to transfer money or approve fake invoices.

Even though systems are well protected, phishing still works because it tricks people. Technology can be secured — humans can still make mistakes.

# Why Spam Is Not Phishing?

**Spam** is mostly just digital noise — annoying messages that clutter your inbox but usually don’t cause real harm.

Phishing, on the other hand, is a targeted attack. It is carefully crafted to trick specific people, like TBFC employees, into clicking links, sharing credentials, or opening malicious files. This makes phishing one of the easiest ways for attackers to break into an organisation.

Spam focuses on **quantity over accuracy**. Messages are sent in bulk to as many users as possible, usually for advertising or promotion, not data theft.

Phishing focuses on **precision**. It aims to deceive the right person at the right time in order to gain access to systems, data, or accounts.

Common intentions behind spam messages:
- **Promotion:** Advertising products, services, or events. Often unsolicited or low-quality.
- **Scams:** Spreading fake offers or “get rich quick” schemes to attract clicks.
- **Traffic generation (clickbait):** Driving users to external sites or boosting ad metrics.
- **Data harvesting:** Collecting active email addresses for future campaigns.

In the above screenshot, it's a sample marketing email offering logistics solutions for the SOC-mas event. We can observe that the intention behind the message is pure marketing.

You need to be careful when analysing each message. Look for the intention behind it. Not every unwanted email is a threat; sometimes it’s just spam that poses no real risk.

Attackers use some common techniques in almost every phishing attempt. In a phishing attack, at least one of the following techniques is present:
- **Impersonation:** Some attackers may act as a person, department, or even a service to lure users. This is a way to gain credibility by impersonating the recipient manager or an important person within the company.

We can easily spot impersonation attempts by looking to see if the sender's email matches the internal domain or the standard email structure of the company. In this case, the sender's domain is a free domain from Gmail, which is not aligned with TBFC's domain.

- **Social Engineering:** Social engineering in phishing is the art of manipulating people rather than breaking technology. Attackers craft believable stories, emails, calls, or chat messages that exploit emotions (fear, helpfulness, curiosity, urgency) and real-world context to lure the recipients of a message.

We can spot multiple social engineering techniques from the previous mail:
- **Impersonation:** Is a type of Social Engineering. The attacker is pretending to be McSkidy!
- **Sense of urgency:** We can observe words such as "urgent" and "immediately" to pressure the recipient.
- **Side channel:** The attacker tries to discourage the recipients from reaching McSkidy using his standard communication channels (phone and email address).
- **Malicious intention:** The attacker is trying to trick the user into giving VPN credentials. They can also try to ask for approval of payments, opening malware, or sharing sensitive data.
