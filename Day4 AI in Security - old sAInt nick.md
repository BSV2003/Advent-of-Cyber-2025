# AI in Security - old sAInt nick
Unleash the power of AI by exploring it's uses within cyber security.

## Learning Objectives
- How AI can be used as an assistant in cyber security for a variety of roles, domains and tasks
- Using an AI assistant to solve various tasks within cyber security
- Some of the considerations, particularly in cyber security, surrounding the use of AI

# AI in Cyber Security

|Features of AI|Cyber Security Relevance|
|--------------|------------------------|
|Processing large amounts of data|Analysing vast data from multiple types of sources. For example, system and network logs together.|
|Behaviour analysis|Tracking normal behaviour and activities over a period of time and flagging anything that is out of the ordinary.|
|Generative AI|Summarising or providing context behind a series of events.|

# Defensive Security

AI agents are being used in blue teaming to speed up detection, investigation, and response, making them quicker and more dependable.
Acting like automated assistants, these agents continuously process telemetry (logs, network flows, endpoint signals) and add context to alerts.
We are also witnessing the integration of AI into vendor appliances—such as AI-assisted firewalling and intrusion detection systems.
Beyond just detecting threats, AI can also assist in automating responses - even in real-time.

# Offensive Security

AI can be a powerful tool in a penetration tester's workflow for reconnaissance and information gathering, from OSINT to analysing noisy scanner outputs and mapping attack surfaces.
This allows the pentester to spend more time on the crucial tasks that require a human touch.

**OSINT:** pen source intelligence (OSINT) is the act of gathering and analyzing publicly available data for intelligence purposes.

# Software

AI is used as a SAST/DAST scanner. These scanners audit and analyse written code and applications for potential vulnerabilities. 

**SAST:** Static Application Security Testing for scanning code
**DAST:** Dynamic Application Security Testing scans running aplications for vulnerabilities

AI agents can be great at identifying vulnerabilities, but are not quite as effective at writing secure code.

# Considerations of AI In Cyber Security

- Use of AI in activities like offensive penetration testing
-- You do not want to explain to a client that their services and websites are down because an AI has caused a race condition or overwhelmed their systems.
- We must think carefully about the data AI learns from, how transparent and fair its decisions are, and how reliable it remains when the unexpected occurs.
- Managing challenges such as keeping data private, securing AI models, and informing users properly requires careful consideration.

# Practical

How AI can be used across three areas of cyber security:

- **Red Team:** Discover how AI can be used to generate scripts to exploit vulnerabilities.
- **Blue Team:** See how AI can be used to analyse web logs of an attack that has occurred.
- **Software:** Harness the power of AI to review source code and identify how vulnerabilities are introduces (i.e., analyse source code for vulnerabilities).
